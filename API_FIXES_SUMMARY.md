## How the Fixes Work

### 1. **Playlist Refresh Flow**
1. User performs an operation (create/merge playlist)
2. Backend processes the request and updates playlists
3. Frontend automatically refreshes playlist list after operation
4. User sees updated playlist information immediately

### 2. **Search Function Flow**
1. User enters search query and presses Enter or clicks Search
2. Frontend calls `/api/search` endpoint
3. Backend searches music library and returns results
4. Frontend displays results with proper error handling

### 3. **Form Submission Flow**
1. User fills out form and submits
2. Frontend handles different submission types (download folder vs URL)
3. For URL downloads: Shows progress and handles completion
4. For download folder: Submits form and refreshes playlists after delay
5. After successful completion: Resets form and refreshes playlists

## Testing

A test script (`test_api.py`) has been created to verify all API endpoints work correctly:

```bash
python test_api.py
```

This script tests:
- Playlist retrieval
- Search functionality
- Playlist refresh
- Settings retrieval
